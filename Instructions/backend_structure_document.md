# Backend Structure Document

## Introduction

This document explains how the behind-the-scenes part of our project works. The backend is like the engine that runs the application, handling tasks such as storing data, managing user actions, and securely communicating with other systems. In this project, our system supports a dashboard and a data entry app for Brazil’s Federal Strategy of Digital Government, ensuring that government initiatives are tracked accurately and securely. The backend plays a critical role by connecting data input from civil servants with a central SharePoint table and updating the monitoring dashboard with key metrics.

## Backend Architecture

Our backend is built on a simple yet powerful structure using Node.js and Express. These familiar tools help us create a clear structure where different parts of the backend can work together smoothly. We use common design patterns that separate responsibilities, which makes the system easier to understand, improve, and scale later on. The architecture supports keeping the system fast and reliable, even when lots of people use it at the same time. This clear division also makes it easier to update small parts of the system without disrupting the whole process.

## Database Management

The project uses a NoSQL database because this type of database is flexible and well-suited for changing data needs. A NoSQL store allows us to structure the information in a way that fits the variety of data coming from different user inputs. In addition to this, Firebase may be used for any real-time functionalities needed in the future. The data that users input, such as progress updates and attachments, is organized and stored efficiently so that it can be quickly retrieved for review on the dashboard. This data is also synced with a central SharePoint table, keeping all records up-to-date and making sure that every update is traceable and safe.

## API Design and Endpoints

The backend exposes a series of APIs that act as bridges between the user interface and the server. These APIs follow a RESTful approach, meaning they use standard web methods to handle actions like logging in, selecting initiatives, inputting data, and reviewing submissions. For example, when a user logs in, an endpoint checks their credentials and, using multi-factor authentication, confirms their access. Another endpoint handles data submission by receiving the progress details and then passing that information to both the dashboard logic and the SharePoint system. In simple terms, these APIs ensure that every piece of information moves smoothly and securely from the front end to storage and back again.

## Hosting Solutions

Our backend is hosted on Microsoft Azure, a cloud service known for its excellent performance and high reliability. Being in the cloud means that the system can scale up when needed, handling more users without slowing down. Azure also provides built-in security and monitoring tools, which help ensure that the system stays safe and up-to-date. The choice of Azure gives us a cost-effective solution with robust support for deployments, making it easier for us to roll out updates and keep the service running smoothly over time.

## Infrastructure Components

To keep the system running well and provide users with a smooth experience, the backend includes several important pieces. A load balancing setup makes sure that no single part of the system gets too busy, while caching mechanisms help speed up response times by keeping frequently accessed data close at hand. There is also a content delivery network-like approach that quickly serves static parts of the application. Additionally, regular synchronization with the SharePoint table ensures that the data shown on the dashboard is current. All these parts work together to manage the heavy lifting behind the scenes and to ensure that the application is always responsive.

## Security Measures

Since the app handles sensitive government data, security is a top priority throughout the backend. Every piece of data moving between the user devices and the server is encrypted, so it is protected from unauthorized access during transit and while stored. We also use strong access controls, meaning that every user has only the permissions needed to perform their tasks. By integrating Azure Active Directory, our system can enforce role-based access control and multi-factor authentication, adding another layer of user verification. Regular security audits and vulnerability checks help us keep potential risks in check, ensuring compliance with Brazil’s LGPD and other data protection regulations. This commitment to security protects not only individual data records but also the system as a whole.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Keeping the backend healthy is an ongoing process. We use Azure’s built-in monitoring tools to continuously check the performance and stability of the system. These tools help us spot any issues early and make necessary adjustments before they become serious problems. Routine maintenance, including software updates and security patches, is carried out regularly to keep the backend running smoothly. In everyday terms, this means that our system is always being looked after, ensuring that users experience minimal downtime or slowdowns.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

In conclusion, the backend is a central part of the system that links user actions with data storage and real-time updates on the dashboard. Built on Node.js and Express, and hosted on Microsoft Azure, it provides a safe, scalable, and responsive engine that supports the goals of Brazil’s Federal Strategy of Digital Government. The use of a NoSQL database, robust API design, well-integrated security measures, and diligent monitoring keeps the platform both reliable and compliant. This thoughtful setup ensures that every progress update is recorded accurately, every user stays informed, and the government’s standards and regulations are met. By focusing on these key areas, our backend stands out as a solid foundation for supporting modern public administration initiatives.
