# App Flow Document

## Introduction

This application serves a dual purpose: it offers civil servants a secure platform to input progress data on the initiatives of Brazil's Estratégia Federal de Governo Digital (EFGD) while also presenting a dynamic monitoring dashboard that displays key metrics. The primary goal is to ensure that all progress updates are accurately recorded, securely transmitted, and visually represented so that managers, policy analysts, and other stakeholders can readily assess how government initiatives are moving forward. The app is built in adherence to official government design manuals and security standards, ensuring a consistent, user-friendly experience across both mobile and desktop devices.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user accesses the application, they first encounter a professionally designed landing or splash screen that introduces the system. From here, users are guided to a sign-up process where they can create an account using their email or, possibly, government-provided credentials integrated with Azure Active Directory. The process involves multi-factor authentication to verify the user's identity and ensure data security. In cases where a user may have forgotten their password, an easy-to-use password recovery mechanism is provided that securely sends instructions via email. This ensures that both managers and data inputters always have secure and seamless access to the application.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon successful sign-in, the user is directed to the main dashboard which acts as the central hub of the application. The dashboard immediately presents a personalized view, displaying a summary of assigned initiatives and relevant tasks. Users will find an intuitive navigation menu that includes options for viewing past progress updates, accessing detailed data input forms, and viewing graphical representations of key performance indicators such as initiative progress, timelines, outputs, and satisfaction ratings. Additional visible elements include notifications on upcoming deadlines and changes to initiatives, ensuring that every user remains informed throughout the project lifecycle.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

After logging in, the user encounters a list of initiatives that are specifically assigned to them, in line with the role-based access control system. Once an initiative is selected, the user is taken to a structured data entry form that adheres to government design standards. Here, the user enters specific progress data including percentages of completion, milestones achieved, challenges encountered, and any supporting documents that validate the progress. The form is designed intuitively so that the user naturally follows through from initiative selection to data entry. After inputting the necessary information, the user reviews a summary page where the details are clearly laid out for verification. Once confirmed, the update is submitted, and a confirmation message reassures the user that the information has been successfully recorded. Additionally, an automated notification feature operates in parallel, alerting users about important deadlines and modifications to initiatives, ensuring a continuous communication loop. Batch integrations pull the submitted data into a SharePoint table, from which the dashboard aggregates and updates key metrics at designated intervals. There is also an administrative module where managers can oversee all submissions, modify permissions, and track authorization status of each update, ensuring that all actions in the app are traceable and compliant with governmental protocols.

## Settings and Account Management

Apart from the daily workflow of data input and dashboard monitoring, users have dedicated sections for managing their account settings. Here, users can update personal information, adjust notification preferences, and, if required, change their password through secure channels. For managers, there is an administrative interface that allows the modification of user roles and permissions, ensuring that each user’s access level is kept appropriate to their responsibilities. After making changes, users can easily return to the main application without disruption, as the settings interface seamlessly integrates back into the overall flow.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The application is designed to handle error states gracefully. If a user inputs invalid data or faces issues such as lost connectivity, the system displays clear and concise error messages indicating the nature of the problem. For example, if mandatory information is missing during the progress update process, the user is redirected to the data entry form with error prompts highlighting the areas that require attention. In the case of connectivity issues or failed submissions, the system provides fallback options that allow users to retry the submission. Strict validation and regular API checks ensure that errors are minimized and that users are guided back to a stable state without losing any data they have already entered.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the initial sign-up to the day-to-day operation of inputting progress data, the user journey is designed for simplicity, clarity, and security. After the initial onboarding process, users are welcomed into a well-organized dashboard that immediately presents all critical initiatives in a format that adheres to government standards. The transition between selecting an initiative, inputting relevant data, reviewing, and finally submitting is streamlined to ensure every step is connected and intuitive. Administrators have the capacity to manage roles and permissions, ensuring compliance across the board. With side-by-side notifications that reinforce deadlines and progress, the entire application fosters a feedback loop that is key to monitoring the execution of the EFGD. The journey ends with real-time (or batched) dashboard updates that empower decision-makers with concise, traceable, and secure information, ensuring that the public sector continues to evolve in line with modern digital government practices.
