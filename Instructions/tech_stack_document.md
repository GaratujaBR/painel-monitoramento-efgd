# Tech Stack Document

## Introduction

The project is a digital dashboard and data input application built specifically for Brazil’s Federal Strategy of Digital Government (EFGD). Its main goal is to help civil servants record and monitor the progress of various government initiatives. By using modern technologies, the application ensures secure data handling, adheres to government design guidelines, and provides easy-to-understand visual metrics. The system is designed for both mobile devices and desktop environments, creating an experience that is user-friendly, secure, and aligned with public administration requirements.

## Frontend Technologies

The user interface is built using React, which allows the app to be responsive and dynamic. React was chosen because it helps create a seamless experience for both desktop and mobile users. The design follows specific government branding guidelines and dashboard layouts, ensuring that every element—from colors to overall layout—aligns with the official design manual. This consistent approach not only makes the app visually appealing but also simplifies navigation and data entry for the end users.

## Backend Technologies

The backend of the application is powered by Node.js and Express. These server-side technologies work together to handle the business logic, manage APIs, and process data securely. A NoSQL database has been chosen for its flexibility in managing varied data forms, which is complemented by Firebase for potential real-time functionalities. Integration with SharePoint via its API is a key component, as it ensures that the central table—updated by managers—is seamlessly interconnected with the app. Furthermore, the system uses Azure Active Directory to implement robust role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The project is hosted on Microsoft Azure, a reliable platform known for its scalability and security. Azure not only manages hosting but also supports continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines that ensure new updates and patches can be deployed efficiently. Version control is maintained through collaboration tools like Replit, which also assists developers with AI-powered code suggestions from tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and Deepseek. This integrated development environment keeps the infrastructure maintained, monitored, and up-to-date while supporting team collaboration.

## Third-Party Integrations

Several third-party services are integrated to enhance both developer productivity and application functionality. The SharePoint API enables seamless communication between the app and the government’s data repository, ensuring that all progress updates and key performance metrics are accurately reflected on the dashboard. Additionally, advanced code generation and intelligent assistance are provided by ChatGPT (using OpenAI's GPT-4 model), Claude AI from Anthropic, Cursor, and Deepseek. These tools serve to boost the development process by offering real-time code suggestions, automated troubleshooting, and effective collaboration, which ultimately results in more robust and error-resistant software.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security is a top priority since the application handles sensitive government data. Measures such as encryption for data at rest and in transit, role-based access controls (RBAC), and multi-factor authentication are implemented using Azure Active Directory. Regular audits and compliance checks help ensure adherence to Brazil’s LGPD (data protection regulations). Performance is also optimized through batch updates to the dashboard, balancing system load while ensuring that key metrics like initiative progress, timelines, and output indicators are updated consistently. These techniques ensure not only a secure experience but also a smooth and efficient user interface.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

In summary, the technology choices made for this project are carefully selected to meet the stringent requirements of a government digital initiative. React provides a responsive and consistent user interface, while Node.js, Express, and a NoSQL database support the robust backend needed for handling sensitive data. Microsoft Azure offers the infrastructure backbone necessary for both scalability and security. The integration of SharePoint ensures that data collection is centralized and accurate, and the evolution of the dashboard provides clear insights into the progress of the EFGD initiatives. With additional support from advanced AI development tools, the project ensures efficiency in coding and maintenance. Together, these choices create a secure, scalable, and user-friendly system that stands out in its commitment to modernizing government operations.
